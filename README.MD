# OVERVIEW
 > This repo is going to contain all of the demo code, code-a-longs, and other course material related to my Typescript course(s).
 >
 > I will exclude the zip folders for demo code, and assorted other details that will just be good practice not to include. Both for security and to make sure my repo is not taking up an enormous amount of space.
 >
 > This Course is called "Boost your JavaScript projects with TypeScript: Learn all about core types, generics, TypeScript + React or Node & more!" and it is taught by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller, Who also taught 
 > the React JS course I took. Both of those can be found on Udemy.


 ## Class Resources Folder:

 > This folder contains the Demo code that will be supplied in order to kickstart the class projects. Because this package/Compiler is simply augmenting base Javascript, it will take me WAY too long to code out everything I'll need my self. Also this instructor most likely won't show anything not relating to the lessons in order to keep things moving smoothly. The Demo Code Contained here will be the SOURCE CODE only. I will move a copy into the proper lesson folder for my own use. 


 ## Section 1 and 2 - Getting Started and Understanding Typescript:

 > While both contained in the same folder Getting started is largely just walking me through installing the Typescript packages, and configureing the compiler. While Understanding Typescript
 > covers the basic functionality of Typescript and how it relates to, and improves upon base Javascript, and how to go about beginning to use it yourself. In this case the different parts of the 
 > lesson are contained in their own TS files. If a lesson did not have a coding portion, I simply continued in the notes portion of the previous lesson with proper seperation.


 ## Section 3 - The Typescipt Compiler and it's Configuration:

 > This lesson contains a bunch of test cases designed to demonstrate how the TS Compiler works, and the ways in which you can customise the compiler. Truthfully while I took as comprehensive notes as I could
 > the video is still an important part of understanding this lesson.


 ## Section 4 - Next Gen JavaScript and Typescript:

 > this lesson covers how typescript interacts with the most up to date versions of JS, and the compilation changes between them.


 ## Section 5 - Classes & Interfaces:

 > This lesson covers both the changes you can make to classes in order to make them more bug proof, and covers the uses of Interfaces which allow you to make creating objects more streamlined and help protect
 > against incorrect input, and force structure into the code. It also covers the kind of properties you can use in addition to further increase control and or flexibility.


 ## Section 6 - Advance Types:

 > This lesson covers a lot of ground fast, and consists of operators and methods to further secure, make data accessible, or just plain structure and streamline your code, and how they are used in conjunction with interfaces, classes, objects, etc...
