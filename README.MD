# OVERVIEW
 > This repo is going to contain all of the demo code, code-a-longs, and other course material related to my Typescript course(s).
 >
 > I will exclude the zip folders for demo code, and assorted other details that will just be good practice not to include. Both for security and to make sure my repo is not taking up an enormous amount of space.
 >
 > This Course is called "Boost your JavaScript projects with TypeScript: Learn all about core types, generics, TypeScript + React or Node & more!" and it is taught by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller, Who also taught 
 > the React JS course I took. Both of those can be found on Udemy.


 ## Class Resources Folder:

 > This folder contains the Demo code that will be supplied in order to kickstart the class projects. Because this package/Compiler is simply augmenting base Javascript, it will take me WAY too long to code out  > everything I'll need my self. Also this instructor most likely won't show anything not relating to the lessons in order to keep things moving smoothly. The Demo Code Contained here will be the SOURCE CODE
 > only. I will move a copy into the proper lesson folder for my own use.
